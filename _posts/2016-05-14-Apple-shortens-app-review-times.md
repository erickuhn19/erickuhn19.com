There was been much talk about Apple competing and generating revenue as a service based business. If you haven't read the [Stratechery blog post](https://stratechery.com/2016/apples-organizational-crossroads/) on it, it's a must read. Now there are reports that Apple is significantly cutting app review times.

[From Bloomberg :](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-12/apple-shortens-app-review-times-in-push-to-boost-service-sales)

> Apple Inc. has cut the approval time for new submissions to its App Store from more than a week to less than two days, part of a broader push to increase revenue from services including mobile applications.

This is a long awaited step in the right direction, however Apple still needs to focus on improving discoverability in the app store. Perhaps a purge of the massive volume of terrible apps in the store, especially the ones that haven't been updated in years. Quality > Quantity
