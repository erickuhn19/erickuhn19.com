This isn’t going to be a full write up of Google I/O 2016\. There are many that do a great job of that, you can read [TechCrunch’s here](http://techcrunch.com/gallery/everything-you-need-to-know-from-the-2016-google-io-keynote/), [The Verge here](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11701030/google-io-2016-keynote-highlights-announcements-recap), and [The Next Web here](http://thenextweb.com/google/2016/05/20/google-io-2016-recap-everything-need-know/#gref).

I’m going to touch on the two things that I am really excited about. The first is Google Home. I’ve been excited about Amazon’s Echo but haven’t jumped in yet. I’ve read and seen examples where the Echo can be a really cool utility because of it’s always listening functionality. I air on the side of Siracusa here [(listen to the ATP 170 to hear his thoughts)](http://atp.fm/episodes/170) and think that the the full stack integrations with merchants isn’t there yet, so it won’t be able to do the things I really would like it to do. However, if I trust any company to do this really well, it’s Google. Google’s core competency is in big data processing and machine learning which is exactly what this product is meant for. I will 100% be a buyer of this product.

If only my new Apple TV had the always listening functionality with enhanced microphones. Apple could have already had a horse in this race. Siri on iPhone and Apple Watch isn’t sufficient because the ‘hey siri’ is way too hit or miss.

[Marco Arment writes up a great piece](https://marco.org/2016/05/21/avoiding-blackberrys-fate) on his fear that Apple is not focusing enough on the machine learning/AI strategy, where its competitors already have an advantage. Let’s see if Apple opens up a Siri API at WWDC next month.

The other Google IO announcement that is really exciting and I plan on diving in much deeper with, is [Firebase.](https://firebase.google.com/)

Firebase was purchased around 18 months ago and this is the [first major addition to the platform.](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11704050/google-firebase-baas-facebook-parse-google-io-2016) With [Parse shutting down](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/) this is a welcome to the developer community that want to rely on back end as a service (BaaS) platforms. I am personally excited and already diving into the documentation to see how I could utilize this service in my next side project. The reason why it’s so intriguing? Google is building this platform to be multi channel: iOS, Android and Web. Back end services are one of those things Google does well and this update to Firebase is going to help fill the void where Parse left off.
