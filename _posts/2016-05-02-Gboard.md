Google has announced today it's launching a keyboard for iOS called [Gboard.](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/gboard-search-gifs-emojis-keyboard.html)

From [TechCrunch:](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/12/google-launches-gboard-an-ios-keyboard-that-lets-you-search-without-a-browser/)

> Of course, the most interesting feature of this keyboard is its direct integration with Google’s services.

> By tapping the included “G” icon, you’re able to immediately search Google without exiting your keyboard and launching a browser or the Google app.

> This allows you to easily search for things like flight times, news articles, restaurant and business listings, weather and more right from your keyboard, then just tap to paste that information into your chat. (You’ll need to give the app access to your location the first time you launch this feature.)

I'm surprised this move did not come sooner, as Microsoft has already realized the power of integrating itself into the keyboard. The SwiftKey acquisition was a telling sign that this space is going to start to heat up.
