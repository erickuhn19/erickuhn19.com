    <p>There was been much talk about Apple competing and generating revenue as a service based business. If you haven’t read the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apples-organizational-crossroads/">Stratechery blog post</a> on it, it’s a must read. Now there are reports that Apple is significantly cutting app review times.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-12/apple-shortens-app-review-times-in-push-to-boost-service-sales">From Bloomberg :</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. has cut the approval time for new submissions to its App Store from more than a week to less than two days, part of a broader push to increase revenue from services including mobile applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a long awaited step in the right direction, however Apple still needs to focus on improving discoverability in the app store. Perhaps a purge of the massive volume of terrible apps in the store, especially the ones that haven’t been updated in years. Quality &gt; Quantity</p>

<p>Listen to Marco and Underscore talk about it on <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Fgm1ElCi0">Under the Radar: 27: Fast App Review.</a></p>
