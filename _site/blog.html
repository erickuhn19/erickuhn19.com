      <p class="meta">January 02, 2016</p>
      <p><p>Recently my new company provided me with an 16GB iPhone 6S. I did everything in my power to circumvent this model, as I was using a iPhone 6 with 64GB at a 70% capacity. Switching to the 16GB seemed unfathomable. Since two iPhones in my pocket was not going to be an option, I told myself I would make this work. First, I needed to make some ground rules or this was going to be a disaster.</p>

      <p><p>I started my programming journey almost a year ago and I’ve recently had a change in philosophy. I’ve decided to exclusively develop iOS apps using the new Swift language Apple debuted last year. This decision did not come lightly. Many conversations, read blog posts and internal pondering if this would be the right move took place before I came to the decision to invest my limited time in learning iOS development.</p>

      <p><p>The last post I touched on classes and in this tutorial we are going to test that class using RSpec. RSpec is described on its <a href="http://rspec.info">website</a> as a behavior driven development for ruby. I think thats a pretty accurate description but to break it down even further, RSpec is a framework to test your code. It was built as a domain specific language, which means it’s built in Ruby with its own syntax but its still just Ruby code.</p>

      <p><p>In the final weeks of Codecademy Labs we had to break off into teams, and choose a final project that will be presented on the last day. My mind instantly raced about what project I would choose. We only had two weeks to complete the project and this is a part time course. Did I want to build one of my pet projects I’ve been planning? Not really, I didn’t want to rush one of those. Maybe I could just think of some small idea and hack it together with a team in two weeks, only to never use it again. That didn’t sound like a good idea either. Then I thought it would be really cool to start some open source project and then be able to continue working on it after the class ended. Create something that not only would be an interesting final project but something real people could use. And maybe other people in the class would eventually contribute to it.</p>

      <p><p>One of the major flaws in my development as a programmer has been access to information without bogging me down. I live in the Rails documentation and have kept it as a tab in my browser for five months now. Lately, I’ve had a need to not only look up the Rails docs but HTML, Bootstrap, Angular, jQquery, jQuery UI and a few others. Needless to say managing five plus tabs in order to sort through documentation is cumbersome and really hinders progress. Too many open tabs in general is a problem for me, but can I fix this one?</p>

I mostly listen on the way to work and whenever I am walking about during the day.

      <p><p>I used to have a WordPress blog. It was super easy to maintain and I used a simple StudioPress template. <a href="www.studiopress.com">StudioPress</a> is awesome by the way. Originally the site was hosted at GoDaddy and it was terrible, so I switched to <a href="www.wpengine.com">WPEngine</a>, which was a really great decision. Their hosting was significantly faster and was much easier to use, plus I was bombarded with upsets every time I logged in. If I were to continue making WordPress sites I would 100% use them, but it’s a premium service and far more expensive.</p>
